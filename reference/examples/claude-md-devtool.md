# DepWatch

## Business
**Client:** Open source project, MIT license
**Industry:** Developer tooling, no revenue model. Maintained by a small team.

## User
**End user:** Senior developer maintaining 5+ repositories, lives in terminal and Slack, checks dependencies weekly
**Need:** Know which dependency updates will break things before merging, not after
**Target feeling:** Precise confidence — the developer trusts the output immediately. No second-guessing, no "let me check manually anyway."

## Stack
Node.js CLI tool. GitHub API (repo scanning), npm/yarn registry APIs (version data), Slack Web API (notifications). No frontend framework. No database. Reads repo state on demand.

## EIID

### Enrichment (collect)
**Have:** GitHub API access to monitored repos, npm/yarn registry for version metadata
**Human input:** None during operation. User configures watched repos and severity thresholds once via CLI.
**Missing:** Private registry support, monorepo workspace detection
**Connect:** GitHub API for package.json and lockfile reading, npm registry for version metadata and changelogs
**Approach:** Automate via code — standard API consumption. High frequency (scanning multiple repos), deterministic, needs rate limit management. Code, not agent.

### Inference (patterns)
**Detect:** Breaking changes via semver analysis, changelog keyword parsing, TypeScript type signature comparison
**Predict:** Migration complexity based on number of affected imports, depth of API surface change, availability of codemods
**Flag:** Production dependency updates with major version bumps or known breaking changes
**Approach:** Differentiate via code — the quality of breaking change detection is the product value. Semver alone misses breaking changes in minor versions. Changelog parsing and type comparison catch what semver does not. Deterministic analysis at scale requires code.

### Interpretation (insights)
**Surface:** "lodash 4.17 to 5.0: type signature changes in _.merge. 3 repos affected. Migration: moderate."
**Frame as:** Risk level, affected repo count, migration complexity estimate, specific breaking changes listed
**Approach:** Differentiate via LLM call — single prompt on structured diff: changelog + type signature delta + affected import count. Produces a natural language risk summary. Graduation: move to template when risk framing patterns stabilize across 50+ summaries.

### Delivery (reach)
**Channels:** Slack DM (urgent: breaking changes in production deps), CLI table output (full scan results), GitHub issue comment (repo-specific updates)
**Triggers:** Breaking change detected in production dependency, weekly scan completed, PR touches affected dependency
**Timing:** Slack DM immediately on detection. CLI report on demand or weekly cron. GitHub comment when PR is opened.
**Approach:** Automate via code — Slack, CLI, and GitHub APIs are commodity delivery channels. High frequency, deterministic formatting, no flexibility needed.

## Technology Constraints
Use npm registry API, NOT scraping npmjs.com.
GitHub API rate limit: 5000 requests/hour authenticated. Batch repo scanning to stay under 50% of limit.
Slack message size limits: 3000 chars per block, 50 blocks per message.
CLI output must work in 80-character terminals.

## Code Architecture
- CLI entry point with subcommands: scan, watch, config, detail, migrate
- Shared core module for registry queries, diff analysis, and risk scoring
- Channel adapters: Slack, CLI table formatter, GitHub issue commenter
- Configuration stored in .depwatch.json in user home directory
- No daemon process. Runs on demand or via external cron (CI, crontab).
- **Tool design:** LLM call receives schema-validated input (structured diff JSON), returns schema-validated output (risk assessment JSON). No free-form prompting.
- **Graduation marker:** `// via LLM call, graduate to template when patterns stabilize`

## Design System
**Framework:** None. No visual interface.
**Token source:** None.
**Direction:** Developer-native communication. Message structure and formatting only. Terse, scannable, actionable.
