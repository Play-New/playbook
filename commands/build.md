# Build

Read `reference/concepts.md` for EIID, graduation, and autoresearch definitions.

## Detect Mode

**1. Does a strategy exist?** Check for CLAUDE.md with an EIID mapping table.

**2. Route:**
- **No EIID mapping** -> stop. "No strategy found. Run `/eiid:strategy` first."
- **EIID mapping exists + no built code** -> run **init mode**
- **EIID mapping exists + built code + user provided a target** -> run **extend mode**
- **EIID mapping exists + built code + no target** -> "Project has code. Provide a target to build."

## Init Mode

### 1. Vision

Before anything technical, have a conversation:

**"Describe what this product should do. Not features — the experience. What does the user see, feel, do? When is this product perfect?"**

Collect descriptions, examples, references, screenshots. Then challenge:
- Complexity that doesn't serve the user. Four steps where two would work. A dashboard where a notification delivers the same value.
- Missing pieces. What happens on failure? What does the first experience look like with no data?
- Better patterns. The EIID mapping shows conversational delivery but they described a dashboard. Which actually serves the user?
- Contradictions. They want it minimal but described 6 surfaces. Which matters more?

When aligned: "Anything else, or should I show you what I'd build?"

### 2. Tests First

Write the complete test suite that encodes the vision before any product code.

Install test infrastructure per the product's shape: visual surfaces need browser tests, APIs need integration tests, agents need response structure tests, CLIs need output tests.

Write tests from the experience, not from implementation:

```
// Good: tests the experience
test('seller arrives at overview, sees prices sorted by opportunity, biggest margin gap first')
test('when competitor drops >20%, push notification within 5 minutes')

// Bad: tests the implementation
test('PriceTable component renders with sorting prop')
test('API returns 200 with price array')
```

For nodes with metrics, tests verify the metric: `test('product matcher accuracy exceeds 90% on test set')`.

Run the tests. They should all fail (the product doesn't exist yet) but be syntactically valid.

### 3. Build Loop

Autonomous until all tests pass.

**Order:** Start from commodity nodes (low risk, clear implementation), then custom, then genesis. Infrastructure before intelligence before surfaces.

For each piece:
1. Re-read CLAUDE.md before starting (context drifts on long builds).
2. Build with full context: EIID mapping, value expected, vision.
3. Run the full test suite. Track which tests flip from failing to passing.
4. On regression: revert, analyze, try differently.
5. When iterations stop producing new approaches: log what was tried, skip, continue.

For Interpretation/Delivery nodes with visual surfaces: make design decisions here, guided by the value expected. What the node needs to communicate determines the visual choices.

### 4. Autoresearch Setup

For nodes marked "autoresearch" in the EIID mapping, set up the loop per the Karpathy framework (see `reference/concepts.md`):

1. **Evaluation set.** The loop needs labeled data to measure against. A product matcher needs correct matches. An anomaly detector needs labeled anomalies. If no evaluation set exists, creating it is the first step. Start small (50-100 labeled examples), expand as the loop runs.
2. **Mutable file.** Designate exactly one file the agent can change for this node: the prompt file, the config, or the logic file. Everything else is frozen.
3. **Metric.** The node's metric from the mapping, computed automatically against the evaluation set. One number.
4. **Time budget.** Set a fixed time per experiment (evaluation included). Short enough to run many experiments, long enough to produce a real measurement.
5. **Run the loop.** The agent reads the mutable file, forms a hypothesis, makes one change, runs the evaluation. `git commit` if the metric improves. `git reset --hard` if it doesn't. No human in the loop. Log each experiment (hypothesis, change, result) to `.eiid/report.md`.

The loop runs autonomously until convergence (improvements < 1% over 10 experiments) or until the time budget for the session is exhausted.

### 5. Report

Write results to `.eiid/report.md`:
- Tests: passed / total / skipped (with reasons)
- EIID coverage: which layers are implemented
- Autoresearch: which loops are set up, baseline metrics
- Skipped pieces: what failed, what was tried
- Decisions: non-obvious choices made during build

---

## Extend Mode

Add a feature or build a piece on top of existing code.

### 1. Vision
Same conversation, scoped to the change. What does the user experience today, and what should change?

### 2. Tests First
Write new tests encoding the change. Run the full existing suite first to confirm the baseline.

### 3. Build
Same autonomous loop. New tests pass, old tests don't break.

### 4. Report
Full test results. Log to `.eiid/report.md`.

## Rules

- Vision before plan. The user describes perfection in their own words. Build understands it before proposing anything.
- Tests are the plan. They encode the vision, track progress, and gate quality.
- Autonomous after vision approval. Log, don't ask.
- All tests pass or skip with reason. Not "mostly pass."
- When iterations stop producing new approaches, skip and report.
- The strategy is truth. If what you're building contradicts CLAUDE.md, stop and report.
- Context drift is real. On builds with 5+ pieces, re-read CLAUDE.md before each piece.
