# Build

Read `reference/concepts.md` for the four layers, graduation, autoresearch, Interface, and World Model definitions.

## Detect Mode

**1. Does a strategy exist?** Check for CLAUDE.md with a playbook mapping table.

**2. Route:**
- **No playbook mapping** -> stop. "No strategy found. Run `/playbook:strategy` first."
- **playbook mapping exists + no built code** -> run **init mode**
- **playbook mapping exists + built code + user provided a target** -> run **extend mode**
- **playbook mapping exists + built code + no target** -> "Project has code. Provide a target to build."

## Init Mode

### 1. Vision

Before anything technical, have a conversation:

**"Describe what this product should do. Not features — the experience. What does the user see, feel, do? When is this product perfect?"**

Collect descriptions, examples, references, screenshots. Then challenge:
- Complexity that doesn't serve the user. Four steps where two would work. A dashboard where a notification delivers the same value.
- Missing pieces. What happens on failure? What does the first experience look like with no data?
- Better patterns. The playbook mapping shows conversational delivery but they described a dashboard. Which actually serves the user?
- Contradictions. They want it minimal but described 6 surfaces. Which matters more?

When aligned: "Anything else, or should I show you what I'd build?"

### 2. Tests First

Write the complete test suite that encodes the vision before any product code.

Install test infrastructure per the product's shape: visual surfaces need browser tests, APIs need integration tests, agents need response structure tests, CLIs need output tests.

Write tests from the experience, not from implementation:

```
// Good: tests the experience
test('seller arrives at overview, sees prices sorted by opportunity, biggest margin gap first')
test('when competitor drops >20%, push notification within 5 minutes')

// Bad: tests the implementation
test('PriceTable component renders with sorting prop')
test('API returns 200 with price array')
```

For nodes with metrics, tests verify the metric: `test('product matcher accuracy exceeds 90% on test set')`.

Run the tests. They should all fail (the product doesn't exist yet) but be syntactically valid.

### 3. Build Loop

Autonomous until all tests pass.

**Order:** Start from commodity nodes (low risk, clear implementation), then custom, then genesis. Infrastructure before intelligence before surfaces.

For each node:
1. Re-read CLAUDE.md before starting (context drifts on long builds).
2. Build with full context: playbook mapping, value expected, vision.
3. Run the full test suite. Track which tests flip from failing to passing.
4. On regression: revert, analyze, try differently.
5. When iterations stop producing new approaches: log what was tried, skip the node, continue.

For Interpretation/Delivery nodes with visual surfaces: make design decisions here, guided by the value expected. What the node needs to communicate determines the visual choices.

### 4. Autoresearch Setup

For nodes marked "autoresearch" in the playbook mapping, set up the loop per the Karpathy framework (see `reference/concepts.md`):

1. **Evaluation set.** The loop needs labeled data to measure against. A product matcher needs correct matches. An anomaly detector needs labeled anomalies. If no evaluation set exists, creating it is the first step. Start small (50-100 labeled examples), expand as the loop runs.
2. **Mutable file.** Designate exactly one file the agent can change for this node: the prompt file, the config, or the logic file. Everything else is frozen.
3. **Metric.** The node's metric from the mapping, computed automatically against the evaluation set. One number.
4. **Time budget.** Set a fixed time per experiment (evaluation included). Short enough to run many experiments, long enough to produce a real measurement.
5. **Run the loop.** The agent reads the mutable file, forms a hypothesis, makes one change, runs the evaluation. Each experiment runs 3+ times — a single improvement means nothing. Accept only if statistically significant (Median Absolute Deviation separates real gains from noise).
6. **Backpressure.** After a benchmark passes, run correctness checks (tests, types, lint). If correctness breaks, reject the improvement even if the metric improved. The metric gets better AND the system stays correct.
7. **Keep or discard.** `git commit` when the improvement is both real (confidence) and correct (backpressure). `git reset --hard` when it isn't. No human in the loop. Log each experiment (hypothesis, change, result, confidence score) to `.playbook/report.md`.

The loop runs autonomously until convergence (improvements < 1% over 10 experiments) or until the time budget for the session is exhausted. Small 1% gains compound over hundreds of iterations into results no human would find.

### 5. Report

Write results to `.playbook/report.md`:
- Tests: passed / total / skipped (with reasons)
- Layer coverage: which layers are implemented
- Autoresearch: which loops are set up, baseline metrics
- Skipped nodes: what failed, what was tried
- Decisions: non-obvious choices made during build

---

## Extend Mode

Add a feature or build a node on top of existing code.

### 1. Vision
Same conversation, scoped to the change. What does the user experience today, and what should change?

### 2. Tests First
Write new tests encoding the change. Run the full existing suite first to confirm the baseline.

### 3. Build
Same autonomous loop. New tests pass, old tests don't break.

### 4. Report
Full test results. Log to `.playbook/report.md`.

## Rules

- Vision before plan. The user describes perfection in their own words. Build understands it before proposing anything.
- Tests are the plan. They encode the vision, track progress, and gate quality.
- Autonomous after vision approval. Log, don't ask.
- All tests pass or skip with reason. Not "mostly pass."
- When iterations stop producing new approaches, skip and report.
- The strategy is truth. If what you're building contradicts CLAUDE.md, stop and report.
- Context drift is real. On builds with 5+ nodes, re-read CLAUDE.md before each node.
- Every defect found manually becomes an automated test. If you catch it by hand twice, the process is broken. This applies to the product code, to the tests themselves, and to the playbook mapping. The system catches its own mistakes or it doesn't work.
