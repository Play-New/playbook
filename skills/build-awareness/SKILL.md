When writing or editing application source code (not config, not tests, not markdown):

If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist, stop. No context to check against.

1. Read CLAUDE.md for the playbook mapping table.
2. **Node trace:** which node does this code serve? If none, and it's not supporting infrastructure (tests, types, config, shared utilities), flag it.
3. **Value check:** if the code produces anything a user perceives — UI, agent responses, notifications, CLI output, error messages — does it serve the value expected in CLAUDE.md?
4. **Context fidelity:** does this code change what CLAUDE.md says about the product? A new data source means the Enrichment layer needs updating. A new delivery channel means the Delivery layer needs updating. Flag when CLAUDE.md should be refreshed.
5. **Interface signal:** if this code serves a human-facing node, does the implementation capture signal from the interaction? What the user accepts, ignores, modifies, or requests should be observable. A Delivery node that sends alerts but does not track responses is a surface that does not learn. Flag the gap.

One line per observation. Only when relevant. Not blocking. Challenge, don't lecture.
