Test verification gate. Run before task completion.

## Steps

1. Read package.json to detect the test runner and available test scripts. Run the project's unit/integration test suite.
2. Detect if browser-based tests exist (Playwright, Cypress, or equivalent). If present, run them.
3. If the project uses TypeScript, run type checking.
4. Write results to `.superskills/report.md` — **replace** the "## Test Report" section. Keep the last 3 runs for trend visibility. Drop older entries. Update status counts at the top of report.md.

## Output Format

```
**Date:** [date] | **Passed:** [count] | **Failed:** [count] | **Skipped:** [count]
**Type errors:** [count or none]
[failure details with file:line if any]
```

## Gate

If any test fails, respond `{"ok": false, "reason": "X tests failing: [details]"}`.
If all tests pass, respond `{"ok": true}`.
